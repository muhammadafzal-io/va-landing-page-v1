    <p><strong>Headquarter services: A key Qualifying Activity under the UAE Free Zone Tax Regime</strong></p>
    <p><em>By Middle East Advisory Group</em></p>

    <p >
      As global businesses reassess their international structures in light of new tax rules worldwide,
      the UAE has emerged as an attractive hub for regional and global headquarters.
      The UAE Corporate Tax Law further facilitates this by recognising
      “Headquarter services to Related Parties” as a Qualifying Activity
      under the Free Zone Tax Regime offering a potential 0% corporate tax rate
      when all conditions are met.
    </p>

    <p>
      For investors and business owners operating group structures across multiple jurisdictions,
      this activity is central to how a UAE Free Zone entity can legitimately operate
      as a management and coordination centre for the wider group.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>1. What Are “Headquarter Services”? </strong></h3>

    <p>
      A Free Zone entity is considered to be providing headquarter services when it administers,
      oversees, or manages the business activities of related parties whether UAE-based or foreign.
    </p>

    <p>This can include providing:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>senior and general management</li>
      <li>strategic decision-making</li>
      <li>business planning and development</li>
      <li>risk management</li>
      <li>group-wide administrative support</li>
      <li>finance, budgeting and treasury coordination</li>
      <li>procurement and vendor management</li>
      <li>HR strategy and group hiring</li>
      <li>IT, technical or operational support</li>
      <li>legal, compliance and governance oversight</li>
      <li>intellectual property administrative management</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In essence, a Free Zone headquarter company acts as the central hub for the group
      (or for a major segment of the group) driving key decisions and coordinating activities
      across multiple entities.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>2. Which Related Parties qualify?</strong></h3>

    <p>For this specific Qualifying Activity, “Related Parties” include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>juridical persons (companies)</li>
      <li>branches of juridical persons</li>
      <li>foreign permanent establishments</li>
      <li>domestic permanent establishments</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is a broader scope than many businesses expect, and it allows both UAE and non-UAE
      group entities to be serviced from a regional or global headquarter in a UAE Free Zone.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>A Free Zone entity may fall within this Qualifying Activity if it provides services such as:</p>

    <p><strong>Strategic and Management Functions</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>approving budgets and business plans</li>
      <li>setting sales or marketing strategies</li>
      <li>deciding on major acquisitions or contracts</li>
      <li>overseeing group-wide KPIs and performance</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Group Service Centre Functions</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>procurement and vendor negotiations</li>
      <li>shared HR services (recruitment, policies, payroll support)</li>
      <li>shared IT services or technical support</li>
      <li>shared finance functions (budgeting, modelling, treasury support)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Risk and Compliance Oversight</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>group-wide compliance and reporting functions</li>
      <li>legal review and governance support</li>
      <li>enterprise-level risk management</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Other Support</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>centralised training and development</li>
      <li>standardising processes across the group</li>
      <li>ensuring operational consistency between subsidiaries</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why “Headquarter Services” are of strategic importance</h3>

    <p>
      Establishing a UAE Free Zone entity to act as a group headquarters allows the group
      to centralise high-value functions in a highly competitive jurisdiction.
      When the Free Zone company meets all the requirements for the Free Zone Tax Regime,
      including substance, qualifying income, transfer pricing compliance, de minimis limits,
      audited financials, it becomes eligible for a <strong>0% corporate tax rate</strong>
      to the income derived from these headquarter services.
    </p>

    <p>This creates a legitimate and internationally recognised framework for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>consolidating strategic management functions in the UAE,</li>
      <li>ensuring proper governance and coordination across global operations, and</li>
      <li>aligning group structures with a tax-efficient environment, provided transfer pricing regulations are applied correctly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Many global groups already operate their regional or international headquarters from
      Dubai or Abu Dhabi for commercial reasons. The Free Zone Tax Regime reinforces the
      UAE’s attractiveness for this purpose under the new tax landscape.
    </p>

    <h3>Important Compliance Notes for Headquarter Companies</h3>

    <p>To qualify for the 0% rate, the Free Zone HQ company must ensure:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>adequate substance in the Free Zone;</li>
      <li>proper transfer pricing policies and documentation;</li>
      <li>charging arm’s length fees to Related Parties;</li>
      <li>only providing Qualifying Activities or staying within de minimis limits;</li>
      <li>maintaining audited financial statements; and</li>
      <li>being incorporated in a recognised Qualifying Free Zone</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If any requirement is breached the entity loses Free Zone Tax Regime eligibility
      for the current year and the next four years. Careful structuring is therefore essential.
    </p>

    <h3>How Middle East Advisory Group Can Help</h3>

    <p>We assist businesses with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>structuring Free Zone headquarter companies;</li>
      <li>assessing whether planned HQ activities qualify under the regime;</li>

      "UAE Free Zones vs Mainland: What Investors Need to Know About Choosing the Right Location",
    excerpt:
      "A practical guide for investors comparing UAE Free Zones and Mainland structures under the new Corporate Tax regime, focusing on tax, substance, and operational considerations.",
    content: `
    <p><strong>By Middle East Advisory Group</strong></p>

<p ">
      The UAE is home to more than 40 free zones, each offering its own regulatory framework and licensing model.
      For new investors, this abundance of choice can be overwhelming.
      Technology hubs like Dubai Internet City, logistics-driven zones such as JAFZA,
      media clusters such as TwoFour54, and financial centres like DIFC and ADGM
      all serve different strategic purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, businesses were drawn to free zones primarily because they allowed
      100% foreign ownership at a time when mainland companies required a local partner.
      With the relaxation of UAE commercial laws, full foreign ownership is now permitted
      for most mainland activities.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, the choice between free zone and mainland is no longer driven by ownership,
      but increasingly by tax, substance, regulatory environment, and operational needs.
    </p>

    <h3>How Do Free Zones and Mainland Differ Today?</h3>

    <p>
      The biggest historical advantage of free zones — full foreign ownership —
      is now largely available on the mainland, except for a limited number of
      strategically sensitive sectors.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>DIFC and ADGM</strong> apply common law frameworks and operate independent courts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sector-specific free zones</strong> such as Dubai Healthcare City or Dubai Media City
        offer tailored regulatory and licensing environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mainland companies</strong> are subject to UAE federal law and the relevant
        Department of Economic Development (DED).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Free zone entities may face restrictions when conducting business directly
      with the UAE mainland unless they appoint a distributor or obtain special approvals.
      Mainland companies can trade freely across the UAE without structural limitations.
    </p>

    <h3>Tax: A Key New Differentiator</h3>

    <p>
      For many years, free zones promoted multi-year tax holidays.
      With the introduction of UAE Corporate Tax, this model no longer applies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Free zone companies are now UAE tax residents and subject to corporate tax
      unless they qualify for the <strong>Free Zone Tax Regime</strong>.
      Misunderstanding this change can create significant compliance risks.
    </p>

    <h3>The Free Zone Tax Regime</h3>

    <p>
      The Corporate Tax Law allows a 0% tax rate on
      <strong>Qualifying Income</strong> earned by a
      <strong>Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP)</strong>,
      but only if strict conditions are met.
    </p>

    <h4>A. Qualifying Free Zone</h4>
    <p>
      Only free zones recognised by Cabinet Decision are eligible.
      Businesses must confirm recognition directly with the free zone authority.
    </p>

    <h4>B. Qualifying Activities</h4>
    <p>
      Only specified activities qualify for the 0% rate.
      Non-qualifying income is generally taxed at 9%.
    </p>

    <h4>C. Sufficient Substance</h4>
    <p>
      Companies must maintain adequate employees, premises,
      and operating expenditure within the free zone.
    </p>

    <h4>D. Other Requirements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>audited financial statements</li>
      <li>transfer pricing compliance and documentation</li>
      <li>staying within de minimis thresholds</li>
      <li>not electing into the standard tax regime</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Failure to meet any requirement results in loss of eligibility
      for the current year and the following four years —
      a significant “five-year lockout”.
    </p>

    <h3>What Should Investors Consider?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>whether the business model qualifies for the 0% regime</li>
      <li>where employees and operations will be located</li>
      <li>whether clients are primarily mainland or international</li>
      <li>need for specialised regulatory environments</li>
      <li>compliance costs and substance requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For many businesses serving local markets,
      a mainland structure may be simpler and more flexible.
      For others, a free zone can offer strategic advantages
      if structured correctly.
    </p>

    <h3>How Middle East Advisory Group Can Help</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>assessing free zone vs mainland suitability</li>
      <li>confirming Qualifying Free Zone status</li>
      <li>structuring operations to preserve 0% eligibility</li>
      <li>evaluating substance, transfer pricing, and CIT exposure</li>
      <li>restructuring non-compliant free zone entities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Choosing the right jurisdiction in the UAE is a strategic decision.
      Under the new Corporate Tax landscape,
      alignment between licensing, operations, and tax planning
      is essential from day one.

      "UAE Corporate Tax Compliance: What Businesses Need to Know",
    excerpt:
      "A detailed overview of UAE Corporate Tax compliance obligations, including registration, audited financial statements, tax return filing, and transfer pricing documentation.",
    content: `
    <p><strong>By Middle East Advisory Group</strong></p>

    <p>
      The introduction of Corporate Tax in the UAE has implemented a number of compliance
      obligations that apply to both resident and non-resident taxpayers.
      It is critical for business owners and entrepreneurs to understand these requirements,
      as the Corporate Tax regime imposes specific timelines for registration,
      financial reporting, and tax return filing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is a detailed overview of the core compliance obligations
      that businesses should be aware of.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Corporate Tax Registration</h3>

    <p>
      All businesses that fall within the scope of the Corporate Tax Law
      must register with the Federal Tax Authority (FTA),
      even if they do not expect to pay tax.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resident taxpayers, including mainland and free zone entities,
      are required to register regardless of whether they earn taxable income
      or expect to claim reliefs or exemptions.
      This also includes natural persons carrying on a business or business activity
      in the UAE once their revenue exceeds AED 1 million in a Gregorian calendar year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Non-resident taxpayers must register if they have a Permanent Establishment (PE)
      or nexus in the UAE. A foreign company with no PE or nexus in the UAE
      does not need to register, even if it derives UAE-sourced income
      subject to withholding tax, which is currently set at 0%.
    </p>

    <p>
      The FTA has issued specific registration timelines for different categories of taxpayers.
      Late registration penalties may apply.
      As a general rule, newly established businesses must register
      within three months of incorporation.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Requirement to Maintain Audited Financial Statements</h3>

    <p>
      Under the UAE Corporate Tax framework,
      certain businesses are required to maintain audited financial statements,
      including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>businesses with revenue exceeding AED 50 million; and</li>
      <li>Qualifying Free Zone Persons (QFZPs) applying the 0% Free Zone Tax Regime.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Many UAE companies were already subject to audit requirements
      under commercial, licensing, or regulatory frameworks.
      However, businesses that previously operated without mandatory audits
      must now adopt formal audit processes for tax compliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preparing audited financial statements requires proper bookkeeping,
      timely financial close processes, and compliance with applicable
      accounting standards. Businesses should ensure systems and controls
      are in place well before their first tax filing deadline.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Standalone Financial Statements</h3>

    <p>
      For corporate tax purposes, businesses must prepare standalone financial statements
      for each legal entity, even where consolidated accounts are prepared
      for other reporting purposes.
      Taxable income is calculated based on the standalone results of each entity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Financial statements must be prepared in accordance with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); or</li>
      <li>IFRS for SMEs, where applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This requirement applies to resident taxpayers and non-resident taxpayers
      with a UAE Permanent Establishment.
      Proper maintenance of books and records is essential,
      as the FTA may review underlying documentation during audits.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Corporate Tax Return Filing and Payment</h3>

    <p>
      Every Taxable Person must file a corporate tax return
      for each Tax Period within nine months from the end of the financial year.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Financial year ending 31 December 2024 → return due 30 September 2025</li>
      <li>Financial year ending 30 June 2025 → return due 31 March 2026</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Returns are filed electronically through the EmaraTax platform.
      Unlike VAT, there are no monthly or quarterly corporate tax filings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Payment of corporate tax (if due) must be made
      within the same nine-month deadline.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Transfer Pricing Documentation</h3>

    <p>
      The UAE Corporate Tax Law adopts internationally aligned transfer pricing rules,
      requiring transactions with related parties and connected persons
      to comply with the arm’s length principle.
    </p>

    <h4>Related Party and Connected Person Disclosure</h4>

    <p>
      A disclosure form must be submitted together with the annual tax return,
      summarising all related party and connected person transactions.
    </p>

    <h4>Master File and Local File</h4>

    <p>
      Businesses meeting prescribed thresholds must prepare:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>a Master File describing the multinational group; and</li>
      <li>a Local File detailing the UAE entity’s controlled transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These documents follow OECD standards and must be provided to the FTA upon request.
      Failure to maintain adequate documentation may result in penalties
      and transfer pricing adjustments.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Staying Compliant in the UAE’s New Tax Environment</h3>

    <p>
      The UAE has rapidly transitioned from a no-corporate-tax environment
      to a fully developed compliance framework.
      Even businesses with modest activity levels must now register,
      maintain accounting records, prepare financial statements,
      and file annual tax returns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Middle East Advisory Group assists clients with corporate tax registration,
      preparation of standalone and audited financial statements,
      annual tax return filing, and transfer pricing documentation.
      We also advise on group structuring and tax governance
      to ensure ongoing compliance while optimising tax positions.

      "Place of Effective Management Risk for Foreign Businesses",
    excerpt:
      "With UAE Corporate Tax now in force, foreign companies managed from the UAE may be treated as UAE tax residents under Place of Effective Management (POEM) rules. This article explains the risks and how entrepreneurs can mitigate them.",
    content: `
    <p>
      Many entrepreneurs living in the UAE run businesses through companies incorporated abroad.
      For years, this was common practice and carried little tax risk.
      However, with UAE Corporate Tax now in force, these structures may fall
      within the UAE tax net through the concept of
      <strong>Place of Effective Management (POEM)</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a foreign company is effectively “run” from the UAE,
      it may already be considered a UAE tax resident,
      regardless of where it is legally incorporated.
    </p>

    <h3>1. The Risk in Simple Terms</h3>

    <p>
      Under the UAE Corporate Tax Law, a foreign company becomes a UAE tax resident
      if it is effectively managed and controlled from the UAE.
      In practical terms, this means the UAE may treat the company as resident
      if strategic decisions are made from within the country.
    </p>

    <p>This can apply even when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the company is legally incorporated abroad;</li>
      <li>board minutes are drafted offshore; and</li>
      <li>the company has no physical presence in the UAE.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      What ultimately matters is where the real strategic decision-making takes place.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Why Foreign Companies Are at Risk</h3>

    <p>
      Over the past decade, many entrepreneurs relocated to Dubai or Abu Dhabi
      while retaining operating, holding, or investment companies overseas.
      Directors and shareholders often approve budgets, sign off investments,
      negotiate contracts, and engage clients while physically based in the UAE.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the UAE had no corporate tax, this posed little concern.
      Today, the same decision-making patterns may inadvertently trigger
      UAE tax residency, exposing the foreign company to UAE Corporate Tax
      on its worldwide income.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Practical Examples</h3>

    <p>
      A foreign company may be considered effectively managed in the UAE if:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the founder or key decision-maker lives in Dubai and approves strategy from there;</li>
      <li>board meetings formally occur offshore, but substantive discussions happen in the UAE;</li>
      <li>the operational leadership team is based in the UAE; or</li>
      <li>the company lacks genuine substance in its country of incorporation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In such cases, the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) may conclude that the company’s
      “mind and management” is located in the UAE.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Possible Consequences</h3>

    <p>
      If a foreign company is treated as a UAE tax resident, it may face:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>UAE Corporate Tax on its worldwide income;</li>
      <li>dual tax residency complications;</li>
      <li>disputes over taxing rights between jurisdictions; and</li>
      <li>new accounting, filing, and compliance obligations in the UAE.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For many founders, these consequences arise unexpectedly
      and can significantly increase tax and compliance exposure.
    </p>

    <h3>5. What Entrepreneurs Should Do to Avoid POEM Risk</h3>

    <p>
      Entrepreneurs living in the UAE who operate foreign companies should regularly review:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>where strategic decisions are genuinely made;</li>
      <li>whether offshore governance arrangements are substantive or merely formal; and</li>
      <li>whether the company has real operational substance in its home jurisdiction.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Conducting an early POEM assessment can help prevent unexpected tax exposure
      and costly compliance issues later.
    </p>

    <h3>6. How Middle East Advisory Group Can Assist</h3>

    <p>
      Middle East Advisory Group regularly assists entrepreneurs to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>assess POEM exposure for foreign companies managed from the UAE;</li>
      <li>design board and governance processes to mitigate risk;</li>
      <li>evaluate whether UAE tax residency is likely; and</li>
      <li>prepare for potential UAE corporate tax registration and compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you would like a confidential assessment of your structure,
      Middle East Advisory Group can guide you through the key risks
      and practical next steps.

      In the UAE, this confirmation takes the form of a
      <strong>Tax Residency Certificate (TRC)</strong> issued by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).
      A TRC is not an immigration document and does not affect visa status.
      It strictly establishes tax residency for a specific 12-month period.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Why Obtaining a UAE Tax Residency Certificate Matters</h3>

    <p>
      A TRC allows individuals to demonstrate to foreign authorities that their centre
      of life — whether through presence, home, work or personal ties — is in the UAE.
      This is particularly important for managing overseas tax exposure,
      banking relationships and treaty relief claims.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Understanding the Different Types of TRCs</h3>

    <p>
      There are two broad types of Tax Residency Certificates issued to individuals:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Domestic TRC</strong><br />
      A domestic TRC confirms that an individual is a tax resident under UAE domestic law.
      This is commonly required by foreign banks or investment providers and serves as
      proof that the person meets the UAE’s internal residency conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Treaty TRC</strong><br />
      A treaty TRC is required when an individual wishes to claim benefits under a
      double tax treaty between the UAE and another country, such as reduced withholding
      tax or exemption from foreign taxation.
      For this certificate, the FTA considers both UAE residency rules and the residency
      article of the relevant tax treaty.
    </p>

    <h3>3. UAE Tax Residency Tests for Individuals</h3>

    <p>
      Holding a UAE residence visa does not automatically make an individual a UAE tax
      resident. Visa status is a supporting factor, but UAE law provides three distinct
      pathways to tax residency.
    </p>

    <h4>183-Day Presence Test</h4>

    <p>
      An individual qualifies as a UAE tax resident if they are physically present in
      the UAE for at least 183 days during any twelve consecutive months.
      This is the most straightforward test and commonly applies to individuals who have
      fully relocated to the UAE.
    </p>

    <h4>90-Day Presence Test</h4>

    <p>
      Under this route, the individual must spend at least 90 days in the UAE during a
      twelve-month period and be either a UAE national, GCC national, or holder of a valid
      UAE residence permit.
    </p>

    <p>In addition, one of the following must apply:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the individual has a permanent place of residence in the UAE;</li>
      <li>the individual is employed in the UAE; or</li>
      <li>the individual carries on a business activity in the UAE.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Primary Place of Residence or Centre of Interests Test</h4>

    <p>
      Even without meeting a specific day-count threshold, an individual may still be
      treated as a UAE tax resident if the UAE is both:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>their usual or primary place of residence; and</li>
      <li>the centre of their financial and personal interests.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This holistic test considers family ties, employment, business activities,
      social connections and overall lifestyle. It is designed for individuals who have
      genuinely relocated to the UAE but travel frequently.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Documentary Requirements</h3>

    <p>
      Depending on the applicable residency test, the FTA may request:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>passport and UAE visa details;</li>
      <li>Emirates ID;</li>
      <li>official UAE entry and exit records;</li>
      <li>tenancy contracts or proof of long-term accommodation;</li>
      <li>employment letters, salary certificates or professional licences;</li>
      <li>evidence of business activity;</li>
      <li>bank statements showing economic ties to the UAE; and</li>
      <li>a written explanation supporting the centre-of-interests position, where relevant.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The FTA may request additional documentation and will only issue the certificate
      once it is satisfied that all residency conditions are met.

      "UAE Corporate Tax: Does Your Business Qualify for Small Business Relief?",
    excerpt:
      "An overview of UAE Small Business Relief under the Corporate Tax regime, explaining eligibility criteria, revenue thresholds, exclusions, and strategic considerations for entrepreneurs.",
    content: `
    <p>
      Small Business Relief is one of the most practical features of the UAE Corporate
      Tax regime for entrepreneurs and smaller enterprises. It allows eligible businesses
      to be treated as if they have no taxable income for a given tax period, significantly
      reducing compliance obligations.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the relief is temporary, subject to strict conditions, and not available
      to all businesses. Below is a clear overview of how Small Business Relief works
      and who can benefit.
    </p>

    <h3>1. What Is Small Business Relief?</h3>

    <p>
      Under the UAE Corporate Tax regime, resident taxpayers may elect to apply
      <strong>Small Business Relief</strong> and be treated as having zero taxable income
      for the relevant tax period.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the relief applies, the business does not calculate taxable income and does
      not apply deductions, tax losses, exempt income rules or other corporate tax reliefs.
      It is a simplified regime designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Revenue Threshold</h3>

    <p>
      The primary condition for Small Business Relief is that the business must have
      revenue below <strong>AED 3 million</strong> for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the current Tax Period; and</li>
      <li>all previous Tax Periods ending on or after 1 June 2023.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If the business exceeds the AED 3 million revenue threshold in any tax period,
      Small Business Relief will no longer be available for that period or future periods.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Members of Multinational Enterprise Groups</h3>

    <p>
      Businesses that are part of a <strong>Multinational Enterprise (MNE) Group</strong>
      are excluded from Small Business Relief if the group’s consolidated global revenue
      is <strong>AED 3.15 billion or more</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This restriction ensures that the relief is targeted only at genuinely small
      domestic businesses and not large international groups.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Qualifying Free Zone Persons</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Qualifying Free Zone Persons (QFZPs)</strong> are also not eligible to apply
      Small Business Relief.
    </p>

    <p>
      A business that wishes to maintain QFZP status — typically to benefit from the 0%
      corporate tax rate on qualifying income — cannot simultaneously elect Small Business
      Relief. Businesses must therefore choose the regime that best aligns with their
      structure and long-term objectives.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Temporary Nature of the Relief</h3>

    <p>
      Small Business Relief applies only to Tax Periods that end on or before
      <strong>31 December 2026</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless the law is amended or extended, the relief will cease after this date.
      Businesses relying on Small Business Relief should plan ahead for the transition
      to the standard corporate tax regime.
    </p>

    <h3>6. How Middle East Advisory Group Can Assist</h3>

    <p>
      Determining whether Small Business Relief is available and appropriate requires
      careful analysis of revenue levels, group structure, and Free Zone status.
    </p>

    <p>
      Middle East Advisory Group assists clients by assessing eligibility, reviewing
      compliance requirements, and advising on whether Small Business Relief or the
      standard corporate tax regime is the better option.
