                2. FEES AND SERVICES
              </h2>
              <p>
                2.1. The Client agrees to pay MEA Group's fees for Services,
                including recurring annual fees charged at prevailing rates. Fee
                increases will be notified with at least 30 days' written
                notice.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.2. Invoices are payable immediately upon issue. Outstanding
                invoices beyond 30 days may incur interest at 4% per annum above
                the applicable base lending rate.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.3. If payment is not received, the Client and Company authorise
                MEA Group to deduct owed amounts from any assets or funds held under
                MEA Group's control. MEA Group may retain a lien over documentation and
                property until full settlement.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.4. The Client acknowledges that failure to pay for services
                may result in the Company being struck off. Liability for fees
                and disbursements continues until formal termination or
                dissolution.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.5. The Client must notify MEA Group in writing within 30 days of
                an annual invoice if Services are no longer required. Failure to
                do so confirms acceptance of the invoice.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.6. Services are provided on an annual basis unless agreed
                otherwise in writing. No refund or reduction will be made for
                partial periods.

                2.8. A termination fee of no less than AED 2,500 is payable upon
                discontinuation of Services, in addition to charges for document
                handling and external disbursements.
